# HarmonicMotionSimulation.py : 

A program that simulates rotational oscillation by use of VPython to visualize the block. This can be used in various applications that would require motion that resembles harmonic motion and, if the code is edited, the use scope could be expanded to applications that resemble oscillatory motion.
